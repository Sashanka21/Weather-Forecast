Developed a weather forecasting model using machine learning techniques to predict weather
conditions. Implemented and compared the performance of various algorithms including Decision
Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Utilized
Grid Search to optimize hyperparameters for each model and achieve the most accurate
predictions.
